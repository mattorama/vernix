Following on from [cleaning shop]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-06-18-cleaning-shop %}), let's install the missing package manager.

* install Homebrew:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

* check things are OK and update:

```
brew doctor
brew update
```

* see what you have available to you:

```
brew tap
brew list
brew cask list
```

* add caskroom:

```
brew tap caskroom/cask
brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
```

* update everything:

```
brew update && brew upgrade
brew update && brew upgrade brew-cask && brew cleanup && brew cask cleanup
```

* make an install script:

```
touch cask_config.sh
chmod a+x cask_config.sh
```

* add content to the install script:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
brew cask install atom
brew cask install google-chrome
brew cask install handbrake
brew cask install skype
brew cask install vlc
```
* script is located [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/bin/cask_config.sh)

* execute the script
```
./cask_config.sh
```
