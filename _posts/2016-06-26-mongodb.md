Following on from [homebrew]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-06-19-homebrew %}), let's install a MongoDB setup.

* use homebrew to install MongoDB

```
brew cask install mongodb
```

* usage: start the server, open the console

```
mongod
mongo
```

* data by default will be stored in `/data/db` so must make this directory:

```
mkdir -p /data/db
```

* install a GUI for it

```
brew cask install robomongo
```

* add homebrew services for handling services

```
brew tap homebrew/services
brew services
```

* example usage:

```
brew services start mongo
brew services restart mysql
brew services list
brew services cleanup
```
